 # Hi, I'm Jadonus. :wave:

Me and my friends call me a nerd, and I agree. I tend to find an interesting hobby and start obsessing over it.
<br>
I am a chronically curious person, and to borrow a quote from Albert Einstein:
>I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.

I feel this quote describes me best.

On this repo you will find many things, including 
 - my stupid projects
 - my slightly less stupid projects
 - my cool projects

You decide which is which. 

At the moment my favorite project is Roads, a bible memory web app. https://roadsbible.vercel.app
This is bound to sometime change however. Visit my [website](https://Jadonus.github.io/Homepage) if you want to read more, but for now bye! :v:
